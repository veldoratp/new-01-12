            know about May Lang Thang through 'music nights in the clouds'. A
            feature of these concerts is that they are held at 16:30 - a
            beautiful time. The most beautiful day of the day with 'clouds
            hanging overhead and sunshine overhead' surrounded by mountains and
            hills, with golden sunshine and pink clouds. The 'in the clouds'
            stage since its inception has gathered the hottest names in the
            village.

          American Idol is an American music competition and reality television
          show. The contest began to be held on June 11, 2002 and is one of the
          most popular television programs in the United States. American Idol
          is licensed from the British show Pop Idol, founded by producer Simon
          Fuller. American Idol was founded with the purpose of finding the most
          promising singers in the United States through a series of auditions
          held around the country. After that, the finalists will be decided by
          the audience's vote by phone. One feature of the program is that after
          the contestants' performances, the judges will give their own comments
          to help the audience orient the contestant they voted for. American
          Idol contestants must be able to sing and not currently have any
          recording contract or be under the management of a music organization.
